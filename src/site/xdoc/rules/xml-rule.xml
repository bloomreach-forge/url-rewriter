          This type of rule will present you with a text field in which you can put the XML that the underlying software
          (Paul Tuckey's Url Rewrite Filter) understands.
          See <a href="http://cdn.rawgit.com/paultuckey/urlrewritefilter/master/src/doc/manual/4.0/index.html">cdn.rawgit.com/paultuckey/urlrewritefilter</a>
          for the documentation.

      <subsection name="Drop cookies when proxying">
        <p>Since <b>2.1.0</b>, when using an advanced rule of type <a href="advanced-rule.html#Type">'proxy'</a>, cookies sent
        by the client will be passed on, where in previous versions they would have been dropped.
        </p>
	<p>A <i>drop-cookies</i> attribute was added to the &lt;to&gt; element in the XML rule to allow you
	  to revert to the old behaviour. See below for an example:</p>
