        <p>
          This type of rule will present you with a text field in which you can put the XML that the underlying software
          (Paul Tuckey's Url Rewrite Filter) understands.
          See <a href="http://cdn.rawgit.com/paultuckey/urlrewritefilter/master/src/doc/manual/4.0/index.html">cdn.rawgit.com/paultuckey/urlrewritefilter</a>
          for the documentation.

      <subsection name="Pass cookies through proxy">
        <p>When using an advanced rule of <a href="advanced-rule.html#Type">type 'proxy'</a>, cookies will be discarded.
          While there are good reasons for this there may be cases where it is desirable to pass the cookies.</p>
        <p>The Tuckey library supports the ability to call a specific Java class rather than the default processing.<br/>
          <b>Since version 2.0.2</b>, a <code>RequestProxyPassCookies</code> class has been added to the URL rewriter
          code base. It is based on Tuckey's <code>RequestProxy</code> and can be used as the <i>class</i> attribute of
          the <i>&lt;run&gt;</i> element in the XML rule.
        </p>
        <p>A rule like this will work the same as the proxy functionality except that it will pass the cookies.</p>
