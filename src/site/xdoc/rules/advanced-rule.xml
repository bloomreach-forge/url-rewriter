    <section name="Advanced Rule">
      <subsection name="Overview">
        <p>
          This type of rule will present you with three input fiels and a couple of checkboxes, namely:
        </p>
        <pre>
  - Description
  - Conditions
  - From
  - To
  - Case Sensitive
  - Type 
  - Use Wildcard Matching
  - Process other rules
        </pre>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Description">
        <p>
          This field is meant to provide a clear description of the rule, so it's clear for other people what it does and why it was created. This will also help you to find it later using the search.         
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Conditions">
        <p>
          These conditions must match for this rule to be processed, click <a href="/rules/conditions.html">here</a> for the documentation.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="From">
        <p>
          Here you can enter the URL that must be rewritten as a regular expression.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="To">
        <p>
          This field takes the URL where the above URL should be rewritten to. It can contain backreferences, variables and functions.
        </p>

      <subsection name="Use Wildcard Matching">
        <p>
          Use wildcard matching instead of regular expressions. A single wildcard (*) will match any single element, ** will match all elements.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Process other rules">
        <p>
          Other rules will be processed after this one succeeds, same as the 'last' flag of Apache's mod_rewrite.
