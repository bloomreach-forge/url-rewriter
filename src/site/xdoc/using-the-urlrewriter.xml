    <section name="Using the URL Rewriter">
      <subsection name="Overview">
        <p>
          In the CMS, in the document section there should be an extra harmonica called 'URL Rewriter'. When you click
          one of folders you will see an overview of the rules with some extra information like the from, to and type of
          redirect. Note that this does not display the conditions, or even if there are any. The rules will be processed
          in the order they appear, so keep this in mind when creating rules of different depth. For example, the rule
          rewriting /abc should come after the rule rewriting /abc/def.</p>
        <p>
          Which rules and conditions have been configured and in what order they will be processed can be seen on the
          status page. By default /rewrite-status, but only accessible locally.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Global Configuration">
        <p>
          On the rulesLocation node (default: /content/urlrewriter) you can set some properties which will affect all rules.
        </p>
        <table cellspacing="0">

          <tr>
            <td>urlrewriter:ignorecontextpath</td>
            <td>setting this to false will require you to prefix all the URLs you want to match with the contextpath,
              use this if you don't strip the context path from your URLs</td>
            <td>true</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>urlrewriter:usequerystring</td>

          <tr>
            <td>urlrewriter:skippedprefixes</td>
            <td>(since 1.04.01) this is a multiple string, each value is a prefix that should not be rewritten</td>
            <td>{/_cmsinternal, /_cmsrest, /_rp, /hn:} </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

            <td>(since 1.04.01) when set to true, POST requests will not be rewritten</td>

      <subsection name="Adding Rules">
        <p>
          When creating a new rule, there are three options:

            <td>This type is the most simple to use, and should cover all the common usecases</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><a href="rules/advanced-rule.html">Advanced Rule</a></td>
            <td>This type supports conditional rewrites and is regular expression based. It should be able to cover almost any usecase.</td>

            <td><a href="rules/xml-rule.html">XML Rule</a></td>
