      <subsection name="What is URL Rewriter?">
        <p>
          URL Rewriter is a servlet filter that is an extension of Paul Tuckey's UrlRewriteFilter,
          but instead of a packaged xml file the filter is fed with data from CMS documents. So dynamically manageable
          instead of statically!
        </p>
        <p>
          See A) <a href="http://urlrewritefilter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/doc/manual/4.0/index.html">urlrewritefilter.googlecode.com</a><br/>
          and B) <a href="http://www.tuckey.org">tuckey.org</a><br/>
        </p>
        <p>
          The URL Rewriter supports the following options:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>temporary-redirect - Redirect with 302 response code</li>
          <li>permanent-redirect - Redirect with 301 response code</li>
          <li>forward - Requests matching the "conditions" for this "rule", and the URL in the "from" element will be internally forwarded to the URL specified in the "to" element.</li>
          <li>redirect - Requests matching the "conditions" and the "from" for this rule will be HTTP redirected</li>
          <li>pre-include</li>
          <li>post-include</li>
          <li>proxy - The request will be proxied to the full url specified.</li>
        </ul>
