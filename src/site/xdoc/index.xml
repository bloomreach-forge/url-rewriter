        <p><b>Enterprise version for Hippo 12</b></p>
        <p>Since Hippo 12, there is an Enterprise-level follow-up of this plugin, called the <b>URL Rewriter Enterprise Add-on</b>.
          It is a copy of this plugin, with some alterations, and it will be maintained and supported by BloomReach.</p>
        <p>
          Please refer to <a href="https://www.onehippo.org/library/enterprise/enterprise-features/url-rewriter/about-url-rewriter.html">URL Rewriter documentation on onehippo.org</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <subsection name="What is URL Rewriter?">
        <p>
          URL Rewriter is a servlet filter that is an extension of Paul Tuckey's UrlRewriteFilter,
          but instead of a packaged xml file the filter is fed with data from CMS documents. So dynamically manageable
          instead of statically!
        </p>
        <p>
          Since version 2.1.0, the plugin uses a Hippo fork of Paul Tuckey's UrlRewriteFilter which is at
          <a href="https://github.com/onehippo/urlrewritefilter">github.com/onehippo/urlrewritefilter</a><br/>
          The original is at <a href="https://github.com/paultuckey/urlrewritefilter">github.com/paultuckey/urlrewritefilter</a>
          with documentation at <a href="http://www.tuckey.org/urlrewrite">www.tuckey.org/urlrewrite</a>.
