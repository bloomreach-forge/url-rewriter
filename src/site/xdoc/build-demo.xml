        <ul>

      <subsection name="Optionally, checkout the source code and build the plugin">
        <p>
          The demo project depends on the latest snapshot (trunk) of the plugin. So you can either set the version in
          your demo to the latest release or build the plugin locally. For the latter, check out the trunk source code
          from the SVN repository:
        </p>
        <source>$ svn co https://forge.onehippo.org/svn/urlrewriter/plugin/trunk urlrewriter-trunk</source>
        <p>
          Build the project using Maven:
        </p>
        <source>$ cd urlrewriter-trunk
$ mvn install</source>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Check out, build and run the demo project">
        <p>Checkout the demo project:</p>
        <source><![CDATA[$ svn co https://forge.onehippo.org/svn/urlrewriter/demo/trunk urlrewriter-demo-trunk]]></source>
        <p>If you didn't build the plugin locally, set the correct release version in the root pom.</p>
        <p>Build and run the demo project:</p>
        <source>$ mvn clean package
$ mvn -P cargo.run</source>
