# URL Rewriter Plugin

Create rewrite rules for your site, based on CMS documents.

URL Rewriter is a servlet filter that is installed before the HST filter in your site application.
It is an extension of Paul Tuckey's UrlRewriteFilter, but instead of a packaged xml file the filter is fed with data 
from CMS documents. So dynamically manageable instead of statically!

# Documentation 

Documentation is available at [bloomreach-forge.github.io/url-rewriter](https://bloomreach-forge.github.io/url-rewriter)

The online documentation is generated by this command from the master branch:

 > mvn -Pgithub.pages clean site:site
 
The output is in the ```/docs``` directory; push it and GitHub Pages will serve the site automatically. 

For rendering documentation on non-master branches, use the normal site command so the output will be in the ```/target``` 
and therefore ignored by Git.

 > mvn clean site:site
